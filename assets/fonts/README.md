# Fonts Directory

This directory contains the custom fonts used in the Health Code app.

## Required Fonts

To use the custom Poppins font family, you need to download and place the following font files in this directory:

- Poppins-Regular.ttf
- Poppins-Medium.ttf
- Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
- Poppins-Bold.ttf

## Download Fonts

You can download the Poppins font family from:
- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins
- Or use the system default fonts by updating the pubspec.yaml file

## Alternative

If you don't want to use custom fonts, you can remove the fonts section from pubspec.yaml and the app will use the system default fonts.
